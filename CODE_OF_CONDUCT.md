# Code of Conduct

## 🤝 **Our Pledge**

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community focused on advancing quantum-safe cryptography and cybersecurity.

## 📋 **Our Standards**

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

### ✅ **Encouraged Behaviors**

- 🙏 Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- 🚀 Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- 🔒 Prioritizing security and privacy in all discussions and contributions
- 📚 Sharing knowledge and helping others learn about quantum cryptography
- 🌍 Welcoming newcomers and helping them get started

### ❌ **Unacceptable Behaviors**
- 💬 The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- 🎭 Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- 🔓 Public or private harassment
- 📍 Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- 🚫 Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- 🔑 Sharing or misusing cryptographic keys, secrets, or security vulnerabilities
- 📊 Misrepresenting security research or making false claims about cryptographic security

## 🛡️ **Enforcement Responsibilities**

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## 🌐 **Scope**

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## 📞 **Enforcement**

### **Reporting Process**
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

- **Primary Contact**: conduct@rivic.io
- **Security Issues**: security@rivic.io (for security-related violations)
- **Escalation**: leadership@rivic.io

### **What to Include in Reports**
- Description of the incident
- When and where it occurred
- Who was involved
- Any supporting evidence (screenshots, links, etc.)
- Impact on you or the community

### **Response Process**
1. **Acknowledgment** - We will acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
2. **Investigation** - We will review the report and gather additional information
3. **Decision** - Community leaders will determine appropriate action
4. **Communication** - We will communicate the outcome to all parties involved
5. **Follow-up** - We will follow up to ensure the issue is resolved

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## ⚖️ **Enforcement Guidelines**

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### **1. Correction**
**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### **2. Warning**
**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### **3. Temporary Ban**
**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### **4. Permanent Ban**
**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## 🔒 **Security-Specific Guidelines**

Given our focus on cryptographic security, we have additional guidelines:

### **Responsible Disclosure**
- 🔍 Report security vulnerabilities privately first
- 📧 Use security@rivic.io for security issues
- ⏰ Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure
- 🤝 Work collaboratively with maintainers on security issues

### **Cryptographic Discussions**
- 📚 Base discussions on established research and standards
- 🎓 Cite appropriate sources for cryptographic claims
- 🔬 Be transparent about limitations and assumptions
- ⚠️ Clearly mark experimental or unproven concepts

### **Compliance and Regulatory**
- 📋 Respect regulatory requirements and compliance needs
- 🌍 Be mindful of international export controls
- 🏛️ Understand the regulatory context of contributions
- ⚖️ Follow applicable laws and regulations

## 🏆 **Recognition**

We believe in recognizing positive contributions to our community:

- 🌟 **Community Champions** - Regular helpful contributors
- 🔒 **Security Researchers** - Responsible vulnerability disclosure
- 📚 **Knowledge Sharers** - Educational content creators
- 🌍 **Mentors** - Those who help newcomers
